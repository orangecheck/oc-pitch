# OrangeCheck
_OrangeCheck is the world’s first Bitcoin-secured trust layer._

> **OrangeCheck funnels Bitcoin’s unforgeable wall of energy into a live stake—minting an incorruptible trust passport that propels Bitcoin into its next wave of adoption.**

---

A refundable Bitcoin bond anchors every account in economic reality, and each live validation of that stake enriches a proprietary reputation graph that drives three complementary products:

| Product | Tagline | Quick Take | Pitch |
|---------|---------|------------|-------|
| **OrangeScore** | *Bitcoin-backed credit score for the borderless internet.* | Converts each Bitcoin stake into a censorship-proof reputation score, unlocking borderless credit while sidelining legacy bureaus. | [SCORE.md](./01_SCORE.md) |
| **OrangeAuth** | *One-click sign-in, secured by a live Bitcoin bond.* | Replaces passwords with an on-chain stake for instant, secure access immune to hacks and censorship. | [AUTH.md](./02_AUTH.md) |
| **OrangeBadge** | *A portable Bitcoin powered badge proving you belong.* | Compresses Bitcoin’s energy into a tamper-proof ID stamp, making fake accounts costly and restoring authenticity online. | [BADGE.md](./03_BADGE.md) |

## The Open Protocol

All OrangeCheck products run on a single bonded-identity backbone—the open-source **[OrangeCheck Protocol Whitepaper](https://github.com/orangecheck/oc-whitepaper)** that we author and steward to keep the standard Bitcoin-only, censorship-resistant, and universally adoptable.

## Why It Matters  

* **Real People, Real Stakes.** Anchoring every account to a refundable Bitcoin deposit makes fake identities ruinously expensive, slashing spam and online fraud.  
* **Instant Trust Anywhere.** The same deposit follows a user across sites and apps—granting sign-in, credit, and reputation without passwords, paperwork, or borders.  
* **Bitcoin’s Adoption Flywheel.** Each verification expands a shared reputation graph and drives fresh on-chain demand, pushing Bitcoin and OrangeCheck forward together.
