# OrangeCheck
_OrangeCheck is the world’s first Bitcoin-secured trust layer._

> **OrangeCheck funnels Bitcoin’s unforgeable wall of energy into a live stake—minting an incorruptible trust passport that propels Bitcoin into its next wave of adoption.**

---

A refundable Bitcoin bond anchors every account in economic reality, and each live validation of that stake enriches a proprietary reputation graph that drives three complementary products:

| Product | Tagline | Quick Take | Pitch |
|---------|---------|------------|-------|
| **OrangeScore** | *Bitcoin-backed credit score for the borderless internet.* | Transforms raw bond checks into a stake-weighted reputation file—credit-bureau economics, online. | [SCORE.md](./01_SCORE.md) |
| **OrangeAuth** | *One-click sign-in, secured by a live Bitcoin bond.* | Password-free, cross-platform authentication that kills CAPTCHAs and phishing. | [AUTH.md](./02_AUTH.md) |
| **OrangeBadge** | *Flash a portable Bitcoin badge that proves you’re real.* | A visible trust stamp for creators, communities, and devices—bots can’t fake the bond. | [BADGE.md](./03_BADGE.md) |

These products share the **same bonded-identity backbone**, compounding data into an a planet-scale reputation moat while monetising three enormous markets—identity verification, frictionless authentication, and reputation analytics.

## The Open Protocol

OrangeCheck also authors and maintains the open-source **[OrangeCheck Protocol Whitepaper](https://github.com/orangecheck/oc-whitepaper)**, ensuring the standard remains Bitcoin-only, censorship-resistant, and universally adoptable.

## Why It Matters

* Bitcoin’s energy makes Sybil attacks *expensive*, turning spam and fraud economics upside-down.  
* A single bond travels anywhere online, but its **history is sticky**, driving network-effect defensibility.  
* Every new verifier enlarges the graph, deepening margins across all three revenue streams.
