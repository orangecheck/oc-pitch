## The Open Protocol

All OrangeCheck products run on a single bonded-identity backbone—the open-source **[OrangeCheck Protocol](https://github.com/orangecheck/oc-whitepaper)** that we author and steward to keep the standard Bitcoin-only, censorship-resistant, and universally adoptable.

## Why It Matters  

* **Bots get priced out.** Real Bitcoin at stake makes mass fake accounts unprofitable.
