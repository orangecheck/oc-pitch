# OrangeCheck - Badge _("OrangeBadge")_
*Flash a portable Bitcoin badge that proves you’re real.*

---

## Problem & Opportunity  

### Problem  
Social feeds, chats, and gated communities drown in fake followers and sock-puppets; creators and brands spend **billions on clunky “verified” systems** that still rely on paper IDs and central platforms.  

### Opportunity  
Creator-economy and fan-membership tools will top **$80 B in annual spend by 2027**. The first friction-free, Bitcoin-bonded badge that any site can read—and no bot can forge—wins the trust layer for every community online.

## Solution & Moat  

### Solution – _The Fix_  
- **Stake-to-Shine.** Users lock a few satoshis to mint a unique, refundable OrangeBadge.  
- **Show & Go.** Drop the badge in any profile, QR, or device; one ping confirms it’s live and funded.  
- **Signal Strength.** Badges can display tiered stake levels, letting communities set their own “skin-in-the-game” threshold.  

### Moat – _Why Others Can’t Catch Up_  
1. **Universal Reader Network.** Every verification call flows through OrangeCheck, feeding a proprietary badge-usage graph.  
2. **Stake = Spam Wall.** Bots must risk real Bitcoin; slashing economics keep imitators unprofitable.  
3. **Brand Lock-In.** Once creators and brands issue tiered Bitcoin badges, audiences expect the same standard everywhere else.
