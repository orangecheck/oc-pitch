# OrangeCheck - _("OrangeAuth")_
*One-click sign-in, secured by a live Bitcoin bond.*

## Problem & Opportunity  

### Problem  
Passwords are porous, CAPTCHAs annoy, and centralized “Login with X” hands user data to gatekeepers—yet credential-stuffing and phishing will still cost businesses **>$17 B in 2025**.

### Opportunity  
Customer Identity & Access Management (CIAM) spend is projected to surpass **$40 B by 2030**. The first provider to replace passwords with a Bitcoin-bonded, cross-platform login captures the authentication rails of the open internet.

## Solution & Moat  

### Solution – _The Fix_  
- **Stake to Sign-In.** Users lock a few satoshis once; the same key signs every login request.  
- **One Click, No Secrets.** Sites ping OrangeAuth; a live, unspent bond proves control—no passwords, no SMS codes.  
- **Universal Session.** The bond works across web, mobile, and IoT, so users glide through any Orange-enabled property.

### Moat – _Why Others Can’t Catch Up_  
1. **Network of Trust.** Each login amplifies our proprietary authentication graph—more data, better risk scoring.  
2. **Skin-in-the-Game Security.** Staked Bitcoin makes brute-force attacks economically futile; imitators without bonds can’t match.  
3. **First-Mover SDKs.** Early integrations lock in developers; switching means forcing users to restake elsewhere.
