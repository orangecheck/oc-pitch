# OrangeCheck - Score _("OrangeScore")_
*Bitcoin-backed credit score for the borderless internet.*

---

## Problem & Opportunity  

### Problem  
The borderless internet still trusts strangers: bots and ad-fraud will bleed **≈ $114 B in 2025**, while sites run **70 B+ one-off ID checks** that never carry reputation forward. 

### Opportunity  
Global spend on those checks is racing toward **$26 B a year by 2029**. The first company to fuse every fresh check into a single, Bitcoin-bonded credit score locks in an Experian-scale data moat for the online economy.

## Solution & Moat  

### Solution – _The Fix_
- **Bonded Identity.** Every user or device posts a tiny, refundable Bitcoin deposit—making the account economically real.  
- **One-Click Trust.** Sites see the live deposit in milliseconds, so honest people glide through while bots face real cost.  
- **OrangeScore.** Each check adds a datapoint to a rolling trust score that follows the user anywhere online.

### Moat – _Why Others Can’t Catch Up_
1. **Data Flywheel.** Every verification enriches our proprietary reputation graph—compounding like a credit bureau.  
2. **Sticky History.** Users can move their deposit, but their score history stays inside OrangeCheck.  
3. **Bitcoin-Only Clarity.** No new token, no regulatory fog—just the most secure ledger on earth backing every score.
